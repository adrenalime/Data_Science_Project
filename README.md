We use Google Colab : https://colab.research.google.com/

In this research, we used Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Sklearn libraries. It was used to read the Pandas library database. We used the Numpy library to convert the values in the data set into a format suitable for linear regression. The heat map feature was used in the Seaborn library. The heat map allowed us to understand the level of relationship between the variables. With the Matplotlib library, we provided a meaningful visualization of the values in the dataset. For example barchart, pie chart, line chart, bar-line chart,bubble chart, scatter. visualizations were used.
